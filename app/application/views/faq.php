                    <p><strong><a id="q1"></a>1. When is Relay?</strong></p>
                    <p>Relay is currently an annual event. This year the Relay event will take place on 10th - 11th October 2015 at Nyayo stadium. </p>
                    <p><strong><a id="q2"></a>2. What if it rains?</strong></p>
                    <p>Relays continue whatever the weather so don't forget the brolly, warm clothes and sensible shoes. </p>
                    <p><strong><a id="q3"></a>3. Do I have to stay for the whole event?</strong></p>
                    <p>Team members will usually stay for the whole event. Teams camp overnight, in between walking laps, but members of the local community can simply attend on the day and can take part in all the Relay's activities. </p>
                    <p><a title=""   class="news-img"><img alt="" src="<?php echo base_url();?>assets/images/event_night.jpg"></a></p>

                    <h3 style="background:#6a4d9b ">Teams</h3>

                    <p><strong><a id="q7"></a>1. How long do we need to run or walk for?</strong></p>
                    <p>It's up to you and the team captain. The only rule is that at least one team member is on the track at all times. Over the course of a Relay, an average team member might spend 2-3 hours on the track in total &ndash; most teams use a rota system to ensure that nobody is walking for too long a period. </p>
                    <p><strong><a id="q8"></a>2. Is Relay For Life a sponsored event?</strong></p>
                    <p>Relay For Life itself is a celebration of the fundraising that has happened in the months leading up to the event. <span style="white-space: pre;">	</span>Team members do not get sponsored to take part in the Relay itself. They raise money before the event through their own fundraising activities, seeking donations to beat cancer and then top up their fundraising with additional fundraising activities during the Relay For Life event.</p>
                    <p><strong><a id="q9"></a>3. Is there an entry fee?</strong></p>
                    <p>No. Each particpant is only requored to pay Ksh. 1200 in order to join a participating team.</p>
                    <p>Please note, entry fees are non-refundable.</p>

                    <p><strong><a id="q10"></a>4. How can my team raise money?</strong></p>
                    <p>There are loads of great ways to raise money for Relay For Life. Once you&rsquo;ve registered your team you will get a booklet packed with fundraising ideas</a> to help you raise as much money as possible. </p>

                    <p><strong><a id="q11"></a>5. How much money do we need to raise?</strong></p>
                    <p>As much as you can! The more money you raise the more people we can help. Why not set yourself a target of Khs.10,000? That's only Ksh.2500 a week over 1 month, divided among 10-15 team members. Easy to do right? Whatever your target, we have lots of fundraising ideas that will help you achieve your goal.</p>
                    <p><strong><a id="q12"></a>6. What should we bring to the event?</strong></p>
                    <p>Energy, humour and motivation, and as many supporters as you can, along with tents, toiletries, warm clothes, refreshments and a sleeping bag. It's also possible to continue your fundraising at the event itself &ndash; for example, why not sell refreshments to other teams or set up some entertainment? </p>

                    <h3 style="background:#6a4d9b ">Cancer Survivors</h3>
                    <p><strong><a id="q14"></a>1. What is Cancer? </strong></p>
                    <p>Cancer is a disease caused by uncontrolled division of abnormal cells. Normally, cells divide to produce more cells only when the body needs them. If cells divide when new ones are not needed, they form a mass of excess tissue called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant ( i.e. cancerous.)</p>
                    <p>The cells in a malignant tumor can invade and damage nearby tissues and organs. Cancer cells can also break away from malignant tumor and travel through the blood stream or lymphatic system to form new tumors in other parts of the body. The spreading of these cancerous cells is called metastasis.</p>
                    <p><strong><a id="q4"></a>1. Who is a cancer survivor? </strong></p>
                    <p>At Relay For Life, anyone who has received a cancer diagnosis is considered to be a cancer survivor. </p>                    <p><strong><a id="q5"></a>2. Who is a caregiver? </strong></p>
                    <p>A caregiver can be anyone that has supported you as a survivor, from taking you to the hospital or simply being there to listen. Caregivers do not need to register but if you provide the Relay committee with their T-shirt size we will provide them with a free T-shirt that they can wear on the day</p>
                    <p><strong><a id="q6"></a>3. What am I expected to do as a cancer survivor? </strong></p>
                    <p>Cancer survivors are the guests of honour at Relay For Life. You will meet other cancer Survivors and walk the first lap to officially open the event. There will be a special refreshments area at the event for you to relax and meet people and enjoy activities/entertainment. Attend the opening ceremony or stay for the whole Relay, it's up to you. </p>

                    <p><strong><a id="q13"></a>4. What types of things will I do if I volunteer? </strong></p>
                    <p>Every Relay For Life event is organised by a volunteer committee who need lots of help before and after the event and on the day. Jobs vary from event to event, you could help organise the Candle of Hope ceremony, contact businesses for support, help teams with their tents, run cancer awareness activities or provide some music or entertainment to help enthuse and motivate the teams.&nbsp;</p>
