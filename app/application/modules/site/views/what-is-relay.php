                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Every Relay For Life event is made up of volunteers forming teams to spend 24-hours together around the track raising money to eradicate cancer. Teams can be made up of friends, families, co-workers, religious groups, classmates, and neighbours. Every team brings its own special energy to the event by hosting on-site fundraisers, creating campsites, and enjoying each other's company while educating the community about cancer prevention. The event gives each community the opportunity to create their own celebration, from Sydney, Australia to Nairobi, Kenya. We gather with a common cause, to support the Kenya Cancer Association through Relay For Life

                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">With your help, we aren't just fighting one type of cancer we're fighting for every birthday threatened by every cancer in every community. Each person who shares the Relay For Life experience can take pride in knowing that they are working to create a world where this disease will no longer threaten our loved ones or rob anyone of another birthday.

                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Relay For Life provides an opportunity for the average person to impact the future of cancer. In Relays around the world, cancer survivors are honoured through a special survivor celebration before each event.

                        Relay For Life gives a chance for those who have lost a loved one to remember their friends and family, in a safe environment, by participating in the overnight Luminaria ceremony.

                        At the conclusion of each Relay For Life, participants commit to continuing the fight back against cancer in their own way. Volunteers in South Africa recently urged their male participants to consider necessary prostate testing through the distribution of a take-home reminder kit at their event, while volunteers in the United Kingdom educated their participants on sun safety.

                    <p style="font-size: 16px;">Relay For Life Unifies Communities. In Neighbouring South Africa, Relay For Life has helped unify communities in her post-apartheid world. Volunteers of many races and different backgrounds come together at Relay events to fight a common enemy: cancer. Relay has demonstrated that despite natural disasters such as in Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and in the United States, communities heal through coming together for a common purpose no matter what the circumstance. Through Relay For Life, we want our communities in Kenya to begin to understand that cancer touches everybody and everyone has a role in supporting our countries' fight against Cancer.
